#Cosmini’s

##Overview 
With the rise in popularity of metaverses, we are excited to announce our addition to it - Cosmini’s/Cherubi’s [working name]. A social media hub where users socialize and showcase their digital pets. Free from physical limits, users decide what their companion will be like; shapes and forms are checked only by their imagination! This application will allow users to sign in and register themselves. Trade, adopt and perform various activities with your pets. Most importantly, you can showcase your fluffy, scaly or ethereal companions to your friends and gain further resources for growing and expanding your team.
